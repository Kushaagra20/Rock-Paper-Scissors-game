This program showcases a simple rock paper scissors game, made with python on VS code. 
You have to simply chose one of the options, and the computer will chose his, and the final result is showcased inside the window.
You can choose the replay game option to play the game again, after the round.

This is a game based fully on random choices and luck.
I have not programmed the algorithm to always win against you.
